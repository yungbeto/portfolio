Hi, I'm **Roby Saavedra**. 

I’m a product designer living in NYC with about 5 years design experience. I’ve worked in branding, advertising, illustration, and more, but my heart is in software. I'll spare you a manifesto about my design beliefs except to say that I value <strong>accessibility</strong> in design above most everything else.
